# Project Overview

## Car Sales Analysis
A car dealership owner, specializing in a diverse range of car models, has requested an analysis of their sales data. To effectively monitor and assess sales performance, they require the development of a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The necessary data has been provided in a CSV file.

## Problem Statement:
* The car dealership owner is encountering difficulties in effectively tracking and analyzing sales performance. There is a critical need for real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) to make informed decisions and identify growth opportunities. The dashboard should address the challenges of monitoring Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) growth, and comparisons with Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) sales.

* Additionally, the owner needs a detailed examination of average prices and cars sold. This includes understanding YTD and MTD average prices, YOY growth in average prices, and comparisons with PTYD figures. Similarly, tracking YTD and MTD cars sold and YOY growth in cars sold is essential for evaluating sales performance.

* To provide a comprehensive view, the dashboard must also include the ability to analyze sales distribution by car body style and color, visualize sales data by dealer region, and present detailed information for each car sale. Addressing these issues will enable better decision-making and help identify trends and opportunities for growth.

## Objective:
The objective is to develop a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for evaluating sales performance. The dashboard will facilitate informed decision-making by delivering detailed views of Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) growth, and comparisons with Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) figures. It will also include an analysis of average prices, cars sold metrics, and sales distribution by car body style, color, and dealer region. This holistic approach aims to enhance the owner’s ability to monitor progress, identify trends, and uncover growth opportunities.

# Info:
### _The CSV file included the following columns:_
1. Dealer_Name: Name of the car dealership.
2. Company: Manufacturer or brand of the car.
3. Model: Specific model of the car.
4. Engine: Type of engine in the car.
5. Transmission: Type of transmission in the car.
6. Color: Color of the car.
7. Price ($): Selling price of the car.
8. Dealer_No: Identification number of the dealership.
9. Body Style: Type of car body (e.g., sedan, SUV).
10. Phone: Contact phone number for the dealership.
11. Dealer_Region: Geographical region where the dealership is located.

## Analysis
* To effectively analyze the car dealership’s sales data, the dashboard will focus on several key areas. The Sales Overview will track Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales, and Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales. This will help in assessing overall sales performance and identifying trends compared to Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales, providing a clear picture of sales progress and growth opportunities.

* The Average Price Analysis will examine both YTD and MTD Average Prices to understand pricing trends over time. YOY Growth in Average Price will highlight how pricing strategies are evolving, while the difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price will reveal significant changes in pricing patterns.

* In terms of Cars Sold Metrics, the analysis will focus on the total number of cars sold year-to-date and month-to-date, as well as Year-over-Year growth. This will allow for an evaluation of sales volume trends and comparisons with historical data to gauge performance.

* The dashboard will also include several analytical components: the YTD Sales Weekly Trend will show sales performance on a weekly basis; YTD Total Sales by Body Style will illustrate sales distribution across different car body styles; and YTD Total Sales by Color will display the contribution of various car colors to total sales. Additionally, YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region will provide a geographical view of sales distribution, while a Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form will present sales trends for each company. Lastly, a detailed grid will offer comprehensive information for each sale, including car model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, and date, facilitating a thorough analysis of sales data.

* By integrating these detailed analyses into the dashboard, the dealership will gain a comprehensive understanding of their sales performance, pricing trends, and market dynamics. This enhanced visibility will enable informed decision-making, help identify growth opportunities, and refine strategies to drive sales and optimize operations. The dashboard will serve as a crucial tool for monitoring progress, uncovering insights, and achieving strategic business objectives.
