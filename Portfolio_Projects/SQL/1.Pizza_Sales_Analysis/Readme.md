## Project Background:
The goal of this project is to analyze the sales data of a pizza business using SQL queries. This analysis offers insights into the business's performance and helps in identifying trends and patterns that can be useful for strategic decision-making. Through this project, I have written a series of SQL queries to address a range of business questions, including order statistics, revenue analysis, customer preferences, and more. The queries involve performing calculations, aggregating data, joining multiple tables, and applying complex operations to extract actionable insights.

## Problem Statement:

The business requires an in-depth analysis of their pizza sales data to optimize operations, understand customer preferences, and make informed decisions about inventory, pricing, and marketing. Specifically, the following questions needed to be answered:

1. Total Number of Orders: Determine how many total orders have been placed to measure the volume of business.
2. Total Revenue: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales to evaluate the financial performance.
3. Highest-Priced Pizza: Identify which pizza is the highest-priced, helping to understand pricing strategies and customer willingness to pay.
4. Most Common Pizza Size: Find out which pizza size is the most frequently ordered to guide inventory planning and menu adjustments.
5. Top 5 Most Ordered Pizzas: Identify the top 5 most ordered pizza types, which could provide insights into customer preferences.
6. Pizza Category Quantities: Determine the total quantity of pizzas ordered within each category to understand category-level performance.
7. Order Distribution by Hour: Analyze order patterns by the hour of the day to help optimize staffing and delivery scheduling.
8. Category-Wise Distribution of Pizzas: Identify how pizzas are distributed across categories to assist in menu planning and marketing efforts.
9. Average Number of Pizzas Ordered Per Day: Calculate the daily average of pizzas sold to assess overall demand trends.
10. 10.Top 3 Pizzas by Revenue: Determine which pizzas generate the most revenue, helping to focus marketing efforts on high-performing products.
11. 11.Revenue Contribution by Pizza Category: Calculate each pizza category's contribution to total revenue, giving insight into which categories are more profitable.
12. 12.Cumulative Revenue Over Time: Track the cumulative revenue generated over time to analyze business performance trends.
13. 13.Top 3 Pizzas by Revenue in Each Category: Identify the top-performing pizzas within each category to fine-tune menu offerings and promotions.
These SQL queries were designed to answer these business questions, providing a comprehensive analysis of the pizza business's performance based on its order and sales data.

This project is part of my data analyst portfolio, demonstrating my ability to use SQL to manipulate and analyze data effectively for business insights.
